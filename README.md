# CN-Demo-A1-20_29_53-SimulationOfTool-OSSEC

We have implemented and simulated OSSEC(Open Source Security Event Correlator), a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) in a client-server setup to detect unauthorized file modifications, failed login attempts, suspicious log entries, cron job persistence, and background processes in real time. The experiment demonstrates detection, alerting, and basic response visibility using a Manager-Agent architecture.
